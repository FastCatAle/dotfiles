# dotfiles for my Arch system

Some things changed... Still WIP  

## Programs used:  
- Text editor: [Helix](https://helix-editor.com)
- Terminal: [foot](https://codeberg.org/dnkl/foot)
- Screenshot utility: [grim](https://wayland.emersion.fr/grim) & [slurp](https://wayland.emersion.fr/slurp)
- Notification daemon: [mako](https://wayland.emersion.fr/mako)
- Menu: [fuzzel](https://codeberg.org/dnkl/fuzzel)
- Window Manager: [Niri](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri)
- Bar: [EWW](https://github.com/elkowar/eww)  

~~For neovim you need to install Plug~~
I use Helix now, and sometimes regular Vim.  
DWL it's a meme that works, but I don't want to maintain a repo JUST to have a functional
desktop. Niri looks more polished so far, but River is alright I guess.
